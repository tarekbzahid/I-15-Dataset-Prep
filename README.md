Dataset Download and Concatenation from MySQL Using Python

## Description

This project provides a Python script to connect to a MySQL database, download tables from it, and concatenate them into a single CSV file. The script is designed to handle large datasets that cannot be downloaded manually or loaded into memory all at once. It uses the pandas library to read and write data and the mysql-connector-python library to connect to the database.

## Requirements

  * Python 3.6 or higher
  * pandas library
  * mysql-connector-python library
  * pymysql library
  * tqdm library
